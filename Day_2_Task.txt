Diffrence between Document and windows objects?

Documents:

 * Documents is an objects inside the window object and we can use the document objects 
   for manipulation inside the document.
   
      Syntax : documents.propertyname (or) window.document.propertyname;
	  
 * Properties related to it stored in the document objects.
 * Document loaded after loading the window because the windows contains documnet.
 * It is the root elements of document object model.
 * It is an object of window.
 * We cannot access window object properties inside the documnet
 * It represent the document loaded inside the window or browser.
 * Example of Document:
    document.title will return the title of document
 * When HTML document is loaded into browser it becomes a document object.
 * Document object is root node for HTML document.
 * Some methods of document object :
    URL,cookie(),getElementById(),getElementByClassName(),getElementByName(),getElementByTagName(),
	write(),writeIn()....
	
	
Window.

 * It represent the browser window in which you are seeing the content.
 * The properties related to it stored in the window objects.
 * It is loaded before the document because window container document.
 * Window is global element for all objects,functions,etc..
 * It is an object of browser.
 * We can access document object properties inside the windows.
 *  Syntax: window.properties;
 * Example for window :
    window.documnet.title.will return the title of document.
 * There are two properties used to determine the size of browser window.
   1) window.innerHeight => inner height of browser windows(in pixels).
